# Web-based Pronunciation Evaluation Interface

Php scriplets for experts to rate utterances:
* Overall quality on 1.0-5.0 scale
* Specific phones on 3-step scale good - bad - really bad

Features:
* Very simple registration.
* Continuing from last point.
* No passwords to complicate user access (careful who you give the link to!).
* Answers are saved into sqlite database.

Is this easy to set up? Maybe. Or maybe it's easier to write your own.

In the intended use, some 140 words by a dozen speakers were rated.
